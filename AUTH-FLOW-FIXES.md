# Authentication Flow Fixes - Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

1. **Role-based Dashboard Routing**: 
   - Fixed the dashboard page to redirect users with 'admin' role to the admin dashboard
   - Previously only 'faculty' users were redirected to the admin dashboard

2. **Admin Dashboard Access Control**:
   - Updated the admin dashboard to allow both 'faculty' and 'admin' users
   - Previously it was checking for 'student' role but not properly handling 'admin' role

3. **Student Dashboard Access Control**:
   - Updated the student dashboard to redirect both 'faculty' and 'admin' users to the admin dashboard
   - Previously it was only redirecting 'faculty' users

4. **Auth Context Improvements**:
   - Enhanced the authentication context to properly fetch user roles from the database
   - Added fallback to user metadata if database lookup fails
   - Ensured consistent role handling during sign-in

## Files Modified

1. `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`:
   - Improved role fetching in the auth state change listener
   - Enhanced signIn function to properly fetch user role from database

2. `/app/dashboard/page.tsx`:
   - Fixed role-based routing to include 'admin' role for admin dashboard

3. `/app/dashboard/admin/page.tsx`:
   - Updated access control to allow both 'faculty' and 'admin' users

4. `/app/dashboard/student/page.tsx`:
   - Updated access control to redirect both 'faculty' and 'admin' users to admin dashboard

## Test Credentials

The following test credentials should now work properly:

1. **Admin User**:
   - Email: admin@com-psu-rizal.com
   - Password: admin
   - Role: admin (redirects to admin dashboard)

2. **Test User 1**:
   - Email: user1@com-psu-rizal.com
   - Password: user1
   - Role: student (redirects to student dashboard)

3. **Test User 2**:
   - Email: user2@com-psu-rizal.com
   - Password: user2
   - Role: student (redirects to student dashboard)

## Flow Verification

The authentication flow now works as follows:

1. User visits landing page
2. If not authenticated, redirected to /auth
3. User signs in with credentials
4. Auth context fetches user role from database
5. User is redirected to appropriate dashboard:
   - 'student' role → /dashboard/student
   - 'faculty' or 'admin' role → /dashboard/admin
6. Dashboards enforce proper role access control

These changes ensure that all user roles are properly handled throughout the authentication and authorization flow.
