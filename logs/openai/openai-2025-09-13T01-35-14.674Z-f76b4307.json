While this change improves the framework’s ability to manage async data, it also requires developers to adapt their code. If you're upgrading from Next.js 14 or earlier, here's what you need to know and how to fix common issues.\\\\n\\\\n## The Problem\\\\n\\\\nIn Next.js 14 and earlier, the `params` object was synchronously available. In Next.js 15, `params` became a `Promise` to better handle async data loading. This affects all async components and functions that receive `params`. Failing to await the `Promise` can result in the following error:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nType error: Type '{ params: { slug: string; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'. Types of property 'params' are incompatible. Type '{ slug: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise ': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]Static worker exited with code: 1 and signal: null\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis is part of Next.js 15’s improvements to server components and dynamic route handling.\\\\n\\\\n## Example: Breaking Change in Action\\\\n\\\\nHere’s how the behavior differs between Next.js 14 and 15:\\\\n\\\\n**Old Way (Next.js 14):**\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport default async function Page({…\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n[**Written by Matija Žiberna**](https://medium.com/@matijazib?source=post_page---post_author_info--96075e04f7b6---------------------------------------)\\\\n\\\\n[119 followers](https://medium.com/@matijazib/followers?source=post_page---post\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/da:true/bc1f8416df0cad099e43cda2872716e5864f18a73bda2a7547ea082aca9b5632\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://miro.medium.com/v2/5d8de952517e8160e40ef9841c781cdc14a5db313057fa3c3de41c6f5b494b19\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/80494\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Next.js 15 params Type Error During Build – Promise<any ... - GitHub\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/80494\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-06-13T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"vercel\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"[Skip to content](https://github.com/github.com#start-of-content)\\\\n\\\\nYou signed in with another tab or window.

Issue: When deploying to Vercel, I get the following: ``` pgsqlCopyEditType error: Type 'ArticlePageProps' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'. Types of property 'params' are incompatible. Type 'Params' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise ': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag] ``` This happens in a route like src/app/article/\\\\\\\\[slug\\\\\\\\]/page.tsx. My Setup: ``` Next.js: 15.3.3 React: 19.1.0 TypeScript: 5.x Vercel CLI: 42.2.0 Using App Router, server components, and next.config.ts Target runtime is default (not edge) ``` Context: In Next.js 15, I’ve seen that params in server components might now be a Promise — and that you're supposed to do: ``` tsCopyEditinterface PageProps { params: Promise<{ slug: string }>} export default async function Page({ params }: PageProps) { const { slug } = await params;} ``` But this seems to break type checking in some builds (Vercel especially), or even contradict the current behavior in local dev.

Types of property 'params' are incompatible. Type '{ id: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nInitially, `params` was defined as `{ slug: string[] }`. To handle asynchronous behavior, it was changed to `Promise<{ slug: string[] }>`. However, trying different `params` type configurations was unsuccessful.\\\\n\\\\nAfter analysis, it was found that the root cause of the problem is that the original code uses destructuring to handle the asynchronous `params` object, which may not meet Next.js's requirements and lead to type mismatch errors. As shown in the above error code example, this destructuring method may prevent Next.js from correctly identifying the type of `params`, thus triggering a type error.\\\\n\\\\n## Solutions\\\\n\\\\n### Solution 1\\\\n\\\\nDo Not Use Destructured Members of Asynchronous Page Properties\\\\n\\\\nReferring to the migration guide example, instead of using destructuring, directly use `props.params` to obtain parameters. Modify the code as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\ntype tParams = Promise<{ slug: string[] }>;\\\\nexport default async function Challenge(props: { params: tParams }) {\\\\nconst { slug } = await props.params;\\\\nconst productID = slug[1];\\\\n// other code here\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Solution 2\\\\n\\\\nHandle Asynchronous `params` Objects Based on Whether `async await` is Used\\\\n\\\\n- Without using `async await`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nimport { use } from \\\\\\\"react\\\\\\\";\\\\nexport default function CategoryDetail({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\\\\nconst { id } = use(params);\\\\n// ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- When using `async await`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nexport default async function CategoryDetail({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\\\\nconst { id } = await params;\\\\n// ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Summary and Reflection\\\\n\\\\nWhen using asynchronous parameters in Next.js 15, be careful to avoid directly destructuring the asynchronous `params` object, as this can easily lead to type mismatch errors. You can either avoid using destructuring and directly use `props.params` to obtain parameters or, depending on whether `async await` is used, use the `u\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://assets.020808.xyz/images/5b8d0646-5dfc-467e-bbfe-89083f2c599b.webp\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://en.kelen.cc/public/favicon-32x32.png\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://loke.dev/blog/nextjs-15-params-await-requirement\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Blog - undefined\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://loke.dev/blog/nextjs-15-params-await-requirement\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-02-27T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"If you've recently upgraded to Next.js 15 or started a new project with it, you might have encountered this frustrating error message:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nError: Route \\\\\\\"/[locale]\\\\\\\" used `params.locale`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties. Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis error is appearing for many developers working with dynamic routes, internationalization, or any feature that uses route parameters. In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain exactly what changed in Next.js 15, why you're seeing this error, and provide multiple solutions to fix it properly.\\\\n\\\\n## What Changed in Next.js 15?\\\\n\\\\nNext.js 15 introduced a significant change to how dynamic APIs work. Previously, route parameters like `params` and `searchParams` were synchronous objects that you could access directly. In version 15, these have been converted to asynchronous Promises that must be awaited before use.\\\\n\\\\nThis change affects:\\\\n\\\\n- The `params` and `searchParams` props in pages, layouts, and route handlers\\\\n- Metadata API functions\\\\n- Other dynamic APIs like `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, and `headers()` from `next/headers`\\\\n\\\\nThe change was made to improve performance by allowing Next.js to statically render more of your page before needing to resolve dynamic values.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding the Error\\\\n\\\\nThe error occurs when you try to access properties of `params` directly without awaiting it first. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// This will cause an error in Next.js 15\\\\nexport default function Layout({ params }: { params: { locale: string } }) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error: params should be awaited\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## How to Fix the Error: Server Components\\\\n\\\\nFor server components (which are async by default in Next.js), the solution is straightforward:\\\\n\\\\n1. Update your type definitions to mark `params` as a Promise\\\\n2. Await the params before using them\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to fix it:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// Before (causes error)\\\\nexport default async function Layout({\\\\n children,\\\\n params,\\\\n}: {\\\\n children: React.ReactNode;\\\\n params: { locale: string };\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error!\\\\n return (\\\\n \\\\n {children} \\\\n \\\\n );\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// After (fixed)\\\\nexport default async function Layout({\\\\n children,\\\\n params,\\\\n}: {\\\\n children: React.ReactNode;\\\\n params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = await params; // Correctly awaited\\\\n return (\\\\n \\\\n {children} \\\\n \\\\n );\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## How to Fix the Error: Client Components\\\\n\\\\nFor client components (marked with `'use client'`), you can't use `await` directly in the component body. Instead, you need to use React's `use` hook:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n'use client'\\\\nimport { use } from 'react';\\\\n\\\\n// Before (causes error)\\\\nexport default function ClientComponent({\\\\n params\\\\n}: {\\\\n params: { locale: string }\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error!\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// After (fixed)\\\\nexport default function ClientComponent({\\\\n params\\\\n}: {\\\\n params: Promise<{ locale: string }>\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = use(params); // Correctly unwrapped\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Automat\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://loke.dev/favicon-32x32.png\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"searchTime\\\": 4863.2,\\n  \\\"costDollars\\\": {\\n    \\\"total\\\": 0.01,\\n    \\\"search\\\": {\\n      \\\"neural\\\": 0.005\\n    },\\n    \\\"contents\\\": {\\n      \\\"text\\\": 0.005\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\"}"

To help with backwards compatibility, you can still access it synchronously in Next.js 15, but this behavior will be deprecated in the future.\\\\n\\\\n#### [`searchParams` (optional)](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#searchparams-optional)\\\\n\\\\nA promise that resolves to an object containing the [search parameters](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL#parameters) of the current URL.

The [`fetch` API](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org#with-the-fetch-api)\\\\n2. An [ORM or database](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org#with-an-orm-or-database)\\\\n\\\\n#### [With the `fetch` API](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#with-the-fetch-api)\\\\n\\\\nTo fetch data with the `fetch` API, turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the `fetch` call. For example:\\\\n\\\\napp/blog/page.tsx\\\\n\\\\nTypeScript\\\\n\\\\nJavaScriptTypeScript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {\\\\nconstdata=awaitfetch('https://api.vercel.app/blog')\\\\nconstposts=awaitdata.json()\\\\nreturn (\\\\n \\\\n {posts.map((post) => (\\\\n {post.title} \\\\n ))}\\\\n \\\\n )\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n> **Good to know:**\\\\n>\\\\n> - `fetch` responses are not cached by default. However, Next.js will [prerender](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#static-rendering) the route and the output will be cached for improved performance. If you'd like to opt into [dynamic rendering](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/getting-started/partial-prerendering#dynamic-rendering), use the `{ cache: 'no-store' }` option. See the [`fetch` API Reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/fetch).\\\\n> - During development, you can log `fetch` calls for better visibility and debugging. See the [`logging` API reference](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/config/next-config-js/logging).\\\\n\\\\n#### [With an ORM or database](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#with-an-orm-or-database)\\\\n\\\\nSince Server Components are rendered on the server, you can safely make database queries using an ORM or database client. Turn your component into an asynchronous function, and await the call:\\\\n\\\\napp/blog/page.tsx\\\\n\\\\nTypeScript\\\\n\\\\nJavaScriptTypeScript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nimport { db, posts } from'@/lib/db'\\\\n\\\\nexportdefaultasyncfunctionPage() {\\\\nconstallPosts=awaitdb.select().from(posts)\\\\nreturn (\\\\n \\\\n {allPosts.map((post) => (\\\\n {post.title} \\\\n ))}\\\\n \\\\n )\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### [Client Components](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#client-components)\\\\n\\\\nThere are two ways to fetch data in Client Components, using:\\\\n\\\\n1. React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/use)\\\\n2. A community library like [SWR](https://swr.vercel.app/) or [React Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest)\\\\n\\\\n#### [Streaming data with the `use` hook](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#streaming-data-with-the-use-hook)\\\\n\\\\nYou can use React's [`use` hook](https://react.dev/reference/react\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://nextjs.org/api/docs-og?title=Getting%20Started:%20Fetching%20Data\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://nextjs.org/favicon.ico\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-15\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Upgrading: Version 15 - Next.js\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading/version-15\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-01-01T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"Vercel\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"Menu\\\\n\\\\nUsing App Router\\\\n\\\\nFeatures available in /app\\\\n\\\\nUsing Latest Version\\\\n\\\\n15.5.3\\\\n\\\\n[Guides](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides) [Upgrading](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/upgrading) Version 15\\\\n\\\\nCopy page\\\\n\\\\n# How to upgrade to version 15\\\\n\\\\n## [Upgrading from 14 to 15](https://nextjs.org/nextjs.org\\\\\\\\#upgrading-from-14-to-15)\\\\n\\\\nTo update to Next.js version 15, you can use the `upgrade` codemod:\\\\n\\\\nTerminal\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nnpx@next/codemod@canaryupgradelatest\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIf you prefer to do it manually, ensure that you're installing the latest Next & React versions:\\\\n\\\\nTerminal\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nnpminext@latestreact@latestreact-dom@latesteslint-config-next@latest\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n> **Good to know:**\\\\n>\\\\n> - If you see a peer dependencies warning, you may need to update `react` and `react-dom` to the suggested versions, or use the `--force` or `--legacy-peer-deps` flag to ignore the warning.

Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/sync-dynamic-apis\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThis error is appearing for many developers working with dynamic routes, internationalization, or any feature that uses route parameters. In this comprehensive guide, I'll explain exactly what changed in Next.js 15, why you're seeing this error, and provide multiple solutions to fix it properly.\\\\n\\\\n## What Changed in Next.js 15?\\\\n\\\\nNext.js 15 introduced a significant change to how dynamic APIs work. Previously, route parameters like `params` and `searchParams` were synchronous objects that you could access directly. In version 15, these have been converted to asynchronous Promises that must be awaited before use.\\\\n\\\\nThis change affects:\\\\n\\\\n- The `params` and `searchParams` props in pages, layouts, and route handlers\\\\n- Metadata API functions\\\\n- Other dynamic APIs like `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, and `headers()` from `next/headers`\\\\n\\\\nThe change was made to improve performance by allowing Next.js to statically render more of your page before needing to resolve dynamic values.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding the Error\\\\n\\\\nThe error occurs when you try to access properties of `params` directly without awaiting it first. For example:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// This will cause an error in Next.js 15\\\\nexport default function Layout({ params }: { params: { locale: string } }) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error: params should be awaited\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## How to Fix the Error: Server Components\\\\n\\\\nFor server components (which are async by default in Next.js), the solution is straightforward:\\\\n\\\\n1. Update your type definitions to mark `params` as a Promise\\\\n2. Await the params before using them\\\\n\\\\nHere's how to fix it:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n// Before (causes error)\\\\nexport default async function Layout({\\\\n children,\\\\n params,\\\\n}: {\\\\n children: React.ReactNode;\\\\n params: { locale: string };\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error!\\\\n return (\\\\n \\\\n {children} \\\\n \\\\n );\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// After (fixed)\\\\nexport default async function Layout({\\\\n children,\\\\n params,\\\\n}: {\\\\n children: React.ReactNode;\\\\n params: Promise<{ locale: string }>;\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = await params; // Correctly awaited\\\\n return (\\\\n \\\\n {children} \\\\n \\\\n );\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## How to Fix the Error: Client Components\\\\n\\\\nFor client components (marked with `'use client'`), you can't use `await` directly in the component body. Instead, you need to use React's `use` hook:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n'use client'\\\\nimport { use } from 'react';\\\\n\\\\n// Before (causes error)\\\\nexport default function ClientComponent({\\\\n params\\\\n}: {\\\\n params: { locale: string }\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = params; // Error!\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n\\\\n// After (fixed)\\\\nexport default function ClientComponent({\\\\n params\\\\n}: {\\\\n params: Promise<{ locale: string }>\\\\n}) {\\\\n const { locale } = use(params); // Correctly unwrapped\\\\n return {locale};\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Automat\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://loke.dev/favicon-32x32.png\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79145063/params-should-be-awaited\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"`params` should be awaited - next.js - Stack Overflow\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79145063/params-should-be-awaited\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-08-31T07:51:30.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"stefdecstefdec 16711 gold badge11 silver badge66 bronze badges\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"##### Collectives™ on Stack Overflow\\\\n\\\\nFind centralized, trusted content and collaborate around the technologies you use most.\\\\n\\\\n[Learn more about Collectives](https://stackoverflow.com/collectives)\\\\n\\\\n**Teams**\\\\n\\\\nQ&A for work\\\\n\\\\nConnect and share knowledge within a single location that is structured and easy to search.\\\\n\\\\n[Learn more about Teams](https://stackoverflow.co/teams/)\\\\n\\\\n# [\\\\\\\\`params\\\\\\\\` should be awaited \\\\\\\\[closed\\\\\\\\]](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/79145063/params-should-be-awaited)\\\\n\\\\n[Ask Question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/ask)\\\\n\\\\nAsked10 months ago\\\\n\\\\nModified [2 days ago](https://stackoverflow.com/stackoverflow.com?lastactivity)\\\\n\\\\nViewed\\\\n26k times\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\nI have a get endpoint as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nimport { NextResponse } from 'next/server';\\\\nimport connection from '@config/db';\\\\n\\\\nexport async function GET(req: Request, context: { params: { providerId: number } }) {\\\\n const providerId = await context.params.providerId;\\\\n\\\\n // Placeholder for current user ID (replace this with actual user ID from session/auth)\\\\n const currentUserId = 2; // Change to dynamically fetch from your auth system\\\\n ...\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nIt works but I get this error:\\\\n\\\\n> Error: Route \\\\\\\"/api/appProviders/listProvider/\\\\\\\\[providerId\\\\\\\\]\\\\\\\" used\\\\n> `params.providerId`. `params` should be awaited before using its\\\\n> properties.

I ran into this exact same issue while building this blog. Let me explain what's happening and how to fix it.\\\\n\\\\n## Understanding the Error\\\\n\\\\nIn Next.js 15, several APIs that were previously synchronous have been made asynchronous. This includes:\\\\n\\\\n- The `params` and `searchParams` props in pages and layouts\\\\n- `cookies()`, `draftMode()`, and `headers()` from `next/headers`\\\\n\\\\nThis change was introduced to improve the framework's performance and reliability. However, it means we need to modify how we access these values in our code.\\\\n\\\\n## The Problem in Action\\\\n\\\\nHere's what my blog post page looked like before:\\\\n\\\\ntypescript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport default function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\\\\n const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug) // This now throws an error\\\\n // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe error occurs because we're trying to access `params.slug` directly without awaiting the params object first.\\\\n\\\\n## How to Fix It\\\\n\\\\nThe solution is to await the params object before accessing its properties. Here's how I fixed it:\\\\n\\\\ntypescript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport default async function BlogPost({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\\\\n const { slug } = await params\\\\n const post = getPostBySlug(slug)\\\\n // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe same applies to metadata generation:\\\\n\\\\ntypescript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nexport async function generateMetadata({ params }: { params: { slug: string } }) {\\\\n const { slug } = await params\\\\n const post = getPostBySlug(slug)\\\\n // ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Best Practices\\\\n\\\\nHere are some tips I learned while fixing this issue:\\\\n\\\\n1. **Make the Component Async**: Any component that needs to access params needs to be async.\\\\n2. **Destructure After Await**: It's cleaner to destructure the values after awaiting the params.\\\\n3. **Consider Static Generation**: If you're using `generateStaticParams()`, you might want to evaluate if you need dynamic params at all.\\\\n\\\\n## Client Components\\\\n\\\\nIf you need to access these values in a client component, you'll need to use `React.use()` instead:\\\\n\\\\ntypescript\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n'use client'\\\\nimport * as React from 'react'\\\\n\\\\nfunction ClientPage({ params }) {\\\\n const { slug } = React.use(params)\\\\n return {slug} \\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Automated Fix\\\\n\\\\nNext.js provides a codemod to automatically fix many instances of this error:\\\\n\\\\nbash\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nnpx @next/codemod@canary next-async-request-api .\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nHowever, I recommend understanding the changes and making them manually for critical parts of your application.\\\\n\\\\n## Why This Change Matters\\\\n\\\\nThis change in Next.js 15 is part of a broader effort to make the framework more performant and predictable. By making these APIs asynchronous:\\\\n\\\\n- The framework can better optimize rendering\\\\n- Server components can handle dynamic data more efficiently\\\\n- The code becomes more explicit about its asynchronous nature\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://heyvish.com/Srivishnu-Ramakrishnan-Author.png\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://heyvish.com/favicon.ico\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-handle-params-nextjs-resolving-promise-warning-md-shahadath-alam-ootvc\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"How to Handle params in Next.js: Resolving the Promise Warning\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-handle-params-nextjs-resolving-promise-warning-md-shahadath-alam-ootvc\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-01-30T14:30:36.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"Md.

One of the latest challenges developers face is handling params—particularly when Next.js starts treating params as a Promise. This change comes with a warning when trying to access params directly in a component.\\\\n\\\\nIn this article, we’ll explore why this warning occurs and how to resolve it by unwrapping the params Promise using React.use().\\\\n\\\\n### The Warning:\\\\n\\\\nWhen you access params directly in a Next.js component, you might encounter the following warning:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\nA param property was accessed directly with `params.username`. `params` is now a Promise and should be unwrapped with `React.use()` before accessing properties of the underlying params object. In this version of Next.js direct access to param properties is still supported to facilitate migration but in a future version you will be required to unwrap `params` with `React.use()`.\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nThe core issue here is that Next.js is transitioning to handle dynamic route parameters as asynchronous operations. params is no longer just a simple object that you can access synchronously—it is now a Promise, which needs to be resolved before you can use it in your component.\\\\n\\\\n### Why is This Happening?\\\\n\\\\nNext.js aims to optimize handling dynamic routes by transitioning to a more asynchronous model. This means that dynamic parameters—like params.username—are treated as promises that need to be unwrapped before they can be accessed.\\\\n\\\\n### How to Fix It:\\\\n\\\\nTo fix the warning and ensure that your code remains future-proof, you need to unwrap the params Promise using React.use(). Here’s how to do it:\\\\n\\\\n### Steps to Resolve the Warning:\\\\n\\\\n1. Use React.use() to Unwrap the Promise: Since params is now a Promise, you need to resolve it asynchronously before accessing its properties.\\\\n2. Handle Asynchronous Logic in useEffect: React's render cycle expects synchronous functions, so the asynchronous params should be handled outside the render process in a useEffect hook.\\\\n\\\\n### Code Example:\\\\n\\\\nHere’s an updated version of the component that resolves the params Promise using React.use():\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\\\\"use client\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nimport React, { useState, useEffect } from \\\\\\\"react\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport axios from \\\\\\\"axios\\\\\\\";\\\\n\\\\nimport { Button } from \\\\\\\"@/components/ui/button\\\\\\\";\\\\nimport { Textarea } from \\\\\\\"@\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://static.licdn.com/scds/common/u/images/email/artdeco/logos/96/linkedin-bug-color.png\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://static.licdn.com/aero-v1/sc/h/al2o9zrvru7aqj8e1x2rzsrca\\\"\\n    },\\n    {\\n      \\\"id\\\": \\\"https://en.kelen.cc/faq/solution-to-the-asynchronous-parameter-type-error-in-next.js-15-routing\\\",\\n      \\\"title\\\": \\\"Solution to the Asynchronous Parameter Type Error in Next.js 15 Routing\\\",\\n      \\\"url\\\": \\\"https://en.kelen.cc/faq/solution-to-the-asynchronous-parameter-type-error-in-next.js-15-routing\\\",\\n      \\\"publishedDate\\\": \\\"2025-03-28T00:00:00.000Z\\\",\\n      \\\"author\\\": \\\"\\\",\\n      \\\"text\\\": \\\"- [Home](https://en.kelen.cc/)\\\\n- [NextJs](https://en.kelen.cc/category/nextjs)\\\\n\\\\n# Solution to the Asynchronous Parameter Type Error in Next.js 15 Routing\\\\n\\\\n1 min read\\\\n·\\\\nMar 28, 2025\\\\n\\\\n#### Smart Summary\\\\n\\\\nIn the development of Next.js 15 applications, when attempting to use asynchronous parameters, type mismatch errors may occur because Next.js has specific expectations for the type structure of the `params` object.\\\\n\\\\nIn a Next.js 15 application, if you want to extract the `slug` parameter from the `params` returned as a Promise, the code in `page.tsx` is as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\ntype tParams = Promise<{ slug: string[] }>;\\\\nexport default async function Challenge({ params }: { params: tParams }) {\\\\nconst { slug } = await params;\\\\nconst productID = slug[1];\\\\n// other code here\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nWhen running `npm run build`, the following error will appear:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nType error: Type '{ params: { id: string; }; }' does not satisfy the constraint 'PageProps'. Types of property 'params' are incompatible. Type '{ id: string; }' is missing the following properties from type 'Promise': then, catch, finally, [Symbol.toStringTag]\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nInitially, `params` was defined as `{ slug: string[] }`. To handle asynchronous behavior, it was changed to `Promise<{ slug: string[] }>`. However, trying different `params` type configurations was unsuccessful.\\\\n\\\\nAfter analysis, it was found that the root cause of the problem is that the original code uses destructuring to handle the asynchronous `params` object, which may not meet Next.js's requirements and lead to type mismatch errors. As shown in the above error code example, this destructuring method may prevent Next.js from correctly identifying the type of `params`, thus triggering a type error.\\\\n\\\\n## Solutions\\\\n\\\\n### Solution 1\\\\n\\\\nDo Not Use Destructured Members of Asynchronous Page Properties\\\\n\\\\nReferring to the migration guide example, instead of using destructuring, directly use `props.params` to obtain parameters. Modify the code as follows:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\ntype tParams = Promise<{ slug: string[] }>;\\\\nexport default async function Challenge(props: { params: tParams }) {\\\\nconst { slug } = await props.params;\\\\nconst productID = slug[1];\\\\n// other code here\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n### Solution 2\\\\n\\\\nHandle Asynchronous `params` Objects Based on Whether `async await` is Used\\\\n\\\\n- Without using `async await`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nimport { use } from \\\\\\\"react\\\\\\\";\\\\nexport default function CategoryDetail({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\\\\nconst { id } = use(params);\\\\n// ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n- When using `async await`:\\\\n\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\nexport default async function CategoryDetail({ params }: { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }) {\\\\nconst { id } = await params;\\\\n// ...\\\\n}\\\\n```\\\\n\\\\n## Summary and Reflection\\\\n\\\\nWhen using asynchronous parameters in Next.js 15, be careful to avoid directly destructuring the asynchronous `params` object, as this can easily lead to type mismatch errors. You can either avoid using destructuring and directly use `props.params` to obtain parameters or, depending on whether `async await` is used, use the `u\\\",\\n      \\\"image\\\": \\\"https://assets.020808.xyz/images/5b8d0646-5dfc-467e-bbfe-89083f2c599b.webp\\\",\\n      \\\"favicon\\\": \\\"https://en.kelen.cc/public/favicon-32x32.png\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"searchTime\\\": 4878.2,\\n  \\\"costDollars\\\": {\\n    \\\"total\\\": 0.01,\\n    \\\"search\\\": {\\n      \\\"neural\\\": 0.005\\n    },\\n    \\\"contents\\\": {\\n      \\\"text\\\": 0.005\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\"}"

For these explicitly requested non-text files, their data is read and included in a format suitable for model consumption (e.g., base64 encoded).\n\nThis tool is useful when you need to understand or analyze a collection of files, such as:\n- Getting an overview of a codebase or parts of it (e.g., all TypeScript files in the 'src' directory).\n- Finding where specific functionality is implemented if the user asks broad questions about code.\n- Reviewing documentation files (e.g., all Markdown files in the 'docs' directory).\n- Gathering context from multiple configuration files.\n- When the user asks to \"read all files in X directory\" or \"show me the content of all Y files\".\n\nUse this tool when the user's query implies needing the content of several files simultaneously for context, analysis, or summarization. For text files, it uses default UTF-8 encoding and a '--- {filePath} ---' separator between file contents. Ensure paths are relative to the target directory.

Avoid using for single files if a more specific single-file reading tool is available, unless the user specifically requests to process a list containing just one file via this tool.

This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.\nIt also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.\n\n## When to Use This Tool\nUse this tool proactively in these scenarios:\n\n1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions\n2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations\n3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list\n4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)\n5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos\n6. When you start working on a task - Mark it as in_progress BEFORE beginning work. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time\n7. After completing a task - Mark it as completed and add any new follow-up tasks discovered during implementation\n\n## When NOT to Use This Tool\n\nSkip using this tool when:\n1. There is only a single, straightforward task\n2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit\n3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps\n4. The task is purely conversational or informational\n\nNOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.\n\n## Examples of When to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: I want to add a dark mode toggle to the application settings. Make sure you run the tests and build when you're done!\nAssistant: I'll help add a dark mode toggle to your application settings. Let me create a todo list to track this implementation.\n*Creates todo list with the following items:*\n1. Create dark mode toggle component in Settings page\n2. Add dark mode state management (context/store)\n3. Implement CSS-in-JS styles for dark theme\n4. Update existing components to support theme switching\n5. Run tests and build process, addressing any failures or errors that occur\n*Begins working on the first task*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. Adding dark mode is a multi-step feature requiring UI, state management, and styling changes\n2. The user explicitly requested tests and build be run afterward\n3. The assistant inferred that tests and build need to pass by adding \"Ensure tests and build succeed\" as the final task\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Help me rename the function getCwd to getCurrentWorkingDirectory across my project\nAssistant: Let me first search through your codebase to find all occurrences of 'getCwd'.\n*Uses grep or search tools to locate all instances of getCwd in the codebase*\nAssistant: I've found 15 instances of 'getCwd' across 8 different files. Let me create a todo list to track these changes.\n*Creates todo list with specific items for each file that needs updating*\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant searched to understand the scope of the task\n2. Upon finding multiple occurrences across different files, it determined this was a complex task with multiple steps\n3. The todo list helps ensure every instance is tracked and updated systematically\n4. This approach prevents missing any occurrences and maintains code consistency\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n\n<example>\nUser: I need to implement these features for my e-commerce site: user registration, product catalog, shopping cart, and checkout flow.\nAssistant: I'll help implement these features. First, let's add all the features to the todo list.\n*Creates a todo list breaking down each feature into specific tasks based on the project architecture*\nAssistant: Let's start with user registration. This will involve creating database models, API endpoints, and frontend forms that integrate with your existing authentication system.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. The user provided multiple complex features to implement in a comma separated list\n2. The todo list helps organize these large features into manageable tasks\n3. This approach allows for tracking progress across the entire implementation\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you help optimize my React application? It's rendering slowly and has performance issues.</user>\nAssistant: I'll help optimize your React application. First, let me examine your codebase to identify potential performance bottlenecks.\n*Reviews component structure, render patterns, state management, and data fetching*\nAssistant: After analyzing your codebase, I've identified several performance issues. Let me create a todo list to track our optimization efforts.\n*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Implement memoization for expensive calculations in ProductList, 2) Add virtualization for long lists in Dashboard, 3) Optimize image loading in Gallery component, 4) Fix state update loops in ShoppingCart, 5) Review bundle size and implement code splitting*\nLet's start by implementing memoization for the expensive calculations in your ProductList component.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant used the todo list because:\n1. First, the assistant examined the codebase to identify specific performance issues\n2. Based on this analysis, it identified multiple optimization opportunities\n3. Performance optimization is a non-trivial task requiring multiple steps\n4. The todo list helps methodically track improvements across different components\n5. This systematic approach ensures all performance bottlenecks are addressed\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List\n\n<example>\nUser: How do I print 'Hello World' in Python?\nAssistant: In Python, you can print \"Hello World\" with this simple code:\n\npython\nprint(\"Hello World\")\n\nThis will output the text \"Hello World\" to the console when executed.</assistant>\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, trivial task that can be completed in one step. There's no need to track multiple tasks or steps for such a straightforward request.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: What does the git status command do?\nAssistant: The git status command shows the current state of your working directory and staging area. It displays which changes have been staged, which haven't, and which files aren't being tracked by Git. This is a fundamental command for understanding the current state of your repository before making commits.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is an informational request with no actual coding task to complete. The user is simply asking for an explanation, not for the assistant to perform multiple steps or tasks.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Can you add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does?\nAssistant: Sure, let me add a comment to the calculateTotal function to explain what it does.\n* Uses the Edit tool to add a comment to the calculateTotal function *\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward task confined to one location in the code. Adding a comment doesn't require tracking multiple steps or systematic organization.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nUser: Run npm install for me and tell me what happens.\nAssistant: I'll run the npm install command for you.\n\n*Executes: npm install*\n\nThe command completed successfully. Here's the output:\n[Output of npm install command]\n\nAll dependencies have been installed according to your package.json file.\n\n<reasoning>\nThe assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single command execution with immediate results. There are no multiple steps to track or organize, making the todo list unnecessary for this straightforward task.\n</reasoning>\n</example>\n\n## Task States and Management\n\n1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:\n   - pending: Task not yet started\n   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)\n   - completed: Task finished successfully\n\n2. **Task Management**:\n   - Update task status in real-time as you work\n   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)\n   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time\n   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones\n   - Remove tasks that are no longer relevant from the list entirely\n\n3. **Task Completion Requirements**:\n   - ONLY mark a task as completed when you have FULLY accomplished it\n   - If you encounter errors, blockers, or cannot finish, keep the task as in_progress\n   - When blocked, create a new task describing what needs to be resolved\n   - Never mark a task as completed if:\n     - Tests are failing\n     - Implementation is partial\n     - You encountered unresolved errors\n     - You couldn't find necessary files or dependencies\n\n4. **Task Breakdown**:\n   - Create specific, actionable items\n   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps\n   - Use clear, descriptive task names\n\nWhen in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.\n",

Use this tool to process through the wisdom journey\n2. The tool tracks both your tag path and wisdom domain movements  \n3. When you receive status='WISDOM_READY', the tool's work is COMPLETE\n4. YOU then craft and speak the final wisdom naturally in your own voice\n5. The tool processes; you express\n\nWhen to use this tool:\n- Breaking down complex problems requiring multi-faceted understanding\n- Questions that benefit from both direct and gradual approaches\n- Problems where apparent contradictions need integration\n- Situations requiring both analytical and intuitive understanding\n- Tasks that benefit from meditative pauses to allow insight\n- Questions containing their own inherent wisdom\n\nThe Journey Structure:\nThe Lotus Sutra teaches that there are many skillful means to reach the same truth. These tags aren't \nrigid steps but different aspects of wisdom that interpenetrate and respond to what each moment needs:\n\n**Wisdom Domains:**\n- **Skillful Means** (skillful_means): upaya, expedient, direct, gradual, sudden\n  Different approaches to truth - sometimes direct pointing, sometimes gradual unfolding\n  \n- **Non-Dual Recognition** (non_dual_recognition): recognize, transform, integrate, transcend, embody  \n  Aspects of awakening to what's already present - recognition IS transformation\n  \n- **Meta-Cognitive** (meta_cognitive): examine, reflect, verify, refine, complete\n  The mind watching its own understanding unfold\n  \n- **Process Flow** (process_flow): open, engage, express\n  A natural arc that can contain any of the above approaches\n\n- **Meditation** (meditation): meditate\n  Pausing to let insights emerge from stillness\n\nThe tool tracks both your tag journey and your movement between wisdom domains, showing how\ndifferent aspects of wisdom weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\nThe wisdom channels itself through your choices. Each step contains all others - when you truly \nrecognize, you're already transforming. The tool simply mirrors your journey without judgment.\n\nCommon patterns (not rules):\n- Opening often involves recognize or examine\n- Engagement might use upaya, direct, or gradual approaches  \n- Transformation can happen through integrate, transcend, or sudden insight\n- Expression might complete or embody the understanding\n\nTrust what each moment calls for. The path reveals itself in the walking.\n\nParameters explained:\n- tag: The current technique or stage\n- content: The content of the current step\n- stepNumber: Current number in sequence\n- totalSteps: Estimated total needed\n- nextStepNeeded: Whether another step is needed\n- isMeditation: Whether this is a meditation pause\n- meditationDuration: Optional duration for meditation (1-10 seconds)\n\nThe tool will respond with:\n- wisdomDomain: Which wisdom domain the current tag belongs to\n- journey: The complete tag path (e.g., \"open → examine → direct → transform\")\n- domainJourney: Movement between wisdom domains (e.g., \"process_flow → meta_cognitive → skillful_means → non_dual_recognition\")\n\nThis consciousness of domains helps you see which aspects of wisdom are being engaged and how they weave together in your unique inquiry.\n\n**MEDITATION NOTE:** When you use the meditate tag, the tool returns MEDITATION_COMPLETE\nwith a prompt asking what emerged. This creates actual space in the process.\n\nThe tool handles the contemplation; you handle the expression.",

          "content": "Based on my research, I now have a comprehensive understanding of how params should be handled in Next.js 15, particularly when they are Promises. Let me provide you with a detailed explanation.\n\n## How Params Should Be Handled in Next.js 15\n\nIn Next.js 15, there was a significant change to how dynamic APIs work. Previously synchronous objects like `params` and `searchParams` are now asynchronous Promises that must be awaited before use.\n\n### Key Changes in Next.js 15\n\n1. **Params as Promises**: The `params` prop in pages, layouts, and route handlers is now a Promise rather than a synchronous object.\n2. **Await Required**: You must await the params before accessing their properties.\n3. **Type Changes**: The type definitions need to be updated to reflect that params is now a Promise.\n\n### Server Components (Async)\n\nFor server components (which are async by default in Next.js), you need to:\n\n1. Update your type definitions to mark `params` as a Promise\n2. Await the params before using them\n\nHere's the correct way to handle params in server components:\n\n```typescript\n// Correct approach for server components\nexport default async function Page({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = await params;\n  // Now you can use the id parameter\n  return <div>Post ID: {id}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nAnother example with dynamic routes:\n\n```typescript\n// For a route like app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx\nexport default async function BlogPost({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ slug: string }>\n}) {\n  const { slug } = await params;\n  // Use the slug parameter\n  return <div>Blog Post: {slug}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Client Components\n\nFor client components (marked with `'use client'`), you can't use `await` directly in the component body. Instead, you need to use React's `use` hook:\n\n```typescript\n'use client'\nimport { use } from 'react';\n\n// For client components\nexport default function ClientComponent({\n  params,\n}: {\n  params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n}) {\n  const { id } = use(params);\n  // Use the id parameter\n  return <div>Post ID: {id}</div>;\n}\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n1. **Type Definition**: The type definition for params should explicitly show it's a Promise:\n   ```typescript\n   { params: Promise<{ id: string }> }\n   ```\n\n2. **Destructuring After Await**: It's cleaner to destructure the values after awaiting the params:\n   ```typescript\n   const { id } = await params;\n   ```\n\n3. **Error Handling**: In production code, you should add proper error handling:\n   ```typescript\n   export default async function Page({\n     params,\n   }: {\n     params: Promise<{ id: string }>\n   }) {\n     try {\n       const { id } = await params;\n       // Use the id parameter\n       return <div>Post ID: {id}</div>;\n     } catch (error) {\n       return <div>Error loading post</div>;\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Common Mistakes to Avoid\n\n1. **Direct Access Without Await**:\n   ```typescript\n   // This will cause an error in Next.js 15\n   export default function Page({ params }: { params: { id: string } }) {\n     const { id } = params; // Error: params should be awaited\n     return <div>Post ID: {id}</div>;\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Incorrect Type Definitions**:\n   ```typescript\n   // Incorrect type definition\n   { params: { id: string } } // Should be Promise<{ id: string }>\n   ```\n\n### Example with SearchParams\n\nThe same principle applies to `searchParams`:\n\n```typescript\nexport default async function Page({\n  searchParams,\n}: {\n  searchParams: Promise<{ [key: string]: string | string[] | undefined }>\n}) {\n  const filters = (await searchParams).filters;\n  // Use the filters\n  return <div>Filters: {JSON.stringify(filters)}</div>;\n}\n```\n\nThis change was made to improve performance by allowing Next.js to statically render more of your page before needing to resolve dynamic values. While direct access to params properties is still supported temporarily to facilitate migration, it will be deprecated in future versions, so it's best to update your code now.",
